You are a Christian, working in an environment where others are not very interested in God and faith. How do you engage with others? How do you combine your personal faith with your life as a professional? How are you in conversation about Jesus?

Most Christian young professionals find it difficult to navigate this. They want to have a job that suits them well, grow in their skills and expertise, make promotion if possible. Above all, they want to be part of the team just as anyone else. To utilize their workplace for sharing their faith is not easy. And they have seen many examples of how n√≥t to do this.

Does this sound familiar to you? Do you want to learn how to talk about Jesus in a way that suits you, is natural and comfortable? Then this is the weekend for you!
