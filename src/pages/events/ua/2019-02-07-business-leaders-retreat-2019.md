We had carefully and deliberately chosen for “Inner peace” as our theme. In our meetings with businesspeople and young professionals all over Europe we discovered how stress and busyness deprive many of us from inner peace an we went on a pilgramage, away from the busyness and towards our Creator. Our retreat was meant to enable the participants to meet Him, so that they would be strengthened and return home fully recharged; enabled to become resilient and stay connected in their daily busy life.

We thank God for the wonderful retreat we had. God's presence was tangible.
