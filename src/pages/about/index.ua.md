### Who are you?
We’re a group of men in the marketplace living out our faith in authentic relationships.

### What does that look like?
For men who have no understanding of the promises of Jesus, we simply spend time interacting with them, at their pace, on such topics as:

* 	What’s the real purpose of life?
* 	Are Christianity and the Bible still credible after all these years?
* 	How can I be a better professional?
* 	How can I make my marriage work?
* 	Where is God?
* 	Who is Jesus?
* 	Can I honestly be accepted and forgiven?

### What kind of people are you looking for?
We welcome every businessman no matter what your background is or how much you know. We’re more interested in how much passion you possess for learning.

### Can You Help Me With Some of the Struggles I’m Having?
We welcome every businessman no matter what your background is or how much you know. We’re more interested in how much passion you possess for learning.

### I know about Jesus but I’ve never really had any relationship with Him, is that OK?
Absolutely that’s OK. The fact that you know even a little about Christ shows that somewhere, sometime, Jesus was tapping on your heart. Just know this: there are CBMCers waiting for you to say… “Yes, I want to get connected to something and someone bigger than me!”

### Doctrinal Statement (from the CBMC Bylaws)
*   We believe in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament as verbally inspired by God and inerrant in the original writings, and that they are of supreme and final authority in faith and life.
* 	We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
* 	We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary and is true God and true man.
*   We believe that man was created in the image of God; that he sinned, and thereby incurred not only physical death, but also spiritual death which is separation from God; and that all human beings are born with a sinful nature, and are sinners in thought, word and deed.
* 	We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice; and that all who believe in Him are justified on the grounds of His shed blood.
* 	We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, in His ascension into Heaven and in His present life there for us as High Priest and Advocate.
* 	We believe in “That blessed hope”, the personal and imminent return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
* 	We believe that all who receive by faith the Lord Jesus Christ are born again of the Holy Spirit and thereby become children of God. Further, we believe in the eternal security of the believer.
* 	We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved, and the everlasting conscious punishment of the lost.
